# Tasks: RCC Remote Docker Streamlining & Enhancement

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-streamlining-rcc-remote/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)

- [ ] T021 [P] Complete Kubernetes example deployment in examples/k8s-complete-example/

## Phase 3.5: Security & Certificate Management
- [ ] T022 Enhanced certificate generation script in scripts/cert-management.sh
- [ ] T023 Non-root user security contexts in Dockerfile and manifests
- [ ] T024 SSL/TLS enforcement validation in deployment configurations

## Phase 3.6: Deployment Automation
- [ ] T025 Kubernetes deployment script in scripts/deploy-k8s.sh
- [ ] T026 Docker deployment script in scripts/deploy-docker.sh

## Phase 3.7: Health Endpoints Implementation
- [ ] T029 Liveness probe endpoint implementation for /health/live
- [ ] T030 Readiness probe endpoint implementation for /health/ready
- [ ] T031 Startup probe endpoint implementation for /health/startup
- [ ] T032 Prometheus metrics endpoint implementation for /metrics

## Phase 3.8: Documentation & User Guides
- [ ] T033 [P] Comprehensive deployment guide in docs/deployment-guide.md
- [ ] T034 [P] Kubernetes setup instructions in docs/kubernetes-setup.md
- [ ] T035 [P] ARC runner integration guide in docs/arc-integration.md
- [ ] T036 [P] Troubleshooting documentation in docs/troubleshooting.md

## Phase 3.9: Validation & Polish
- [ ] T037 [P] End-to-end deployment validation test
- [ ] T038 [P] Performance validation for <5 minute deployment requirement
- [ ] T039 [P] Load testing validation for 100+ concurrent clients
- [ ] T040 [P] High availability validation for 99.9% uptime target
- [ ] T041 Update existing documentation with new deployment options

## Dependencies
- Setup (T001-T004) before all other phases
- Tests (T005-T010) before implementation (T011-T032)
- Core infrastructure (T011-T018) before variants (T019-T021)
- Security (T022-T024) can run parallel with deployment automation (T025-T028)
- Health endpoints (T029-T032) depend on core infrastructure
- Documentation (T033-T036) can run parallel with implementation
- Validation (T037-T041) after all implementation complete

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Phase 3.2 - All Tests in Parallel
```bash
# Launch all contract and integration tests together:
Task: "Contract test health endpoints in tests/contract/test_health_api.sh"
Task: "Contract test deployment API in tests/contract/test_deployment_api.sh"
Task: "Integration test Docker deployment in tests/integration/test_docker_deployment.sh"
Task: "Integration test k3d deployment in tests/integration/test_k8s_deployment.sh" 
Task: "Integration test RCC connectivity in tests/integration/test_rcc_connectivity.sh"
Task: "Load test concurrent clients in tests/load/test_concurrent_clients.sh"
```

### Phase 3.3 - Independent Kubernetes Manifests
```bash
# Launch independent manifest creation:
Task: "Kubernetes namespace in k8s/namespace.yaml"
Task: "ConfigMap configuration in k8s/configmap.yaml"
Task: "Secret management in k8s/secret.yaml"
Task: "PersistentVolume configuration in k8s/persistent-volume.yaml"
Task: "Ingress configuration in k8s/ingress.yaml"
Task: "Health check configuration in k8s/health-check.yaml"
```

### Phase 3.8 - Documentation in Parallel
```bash
# Launch all documentation tasks:
Task: "Deployment guide in docs/deployment-guide.md"
Task: "Kubernetes setup in docs/kubernetes-setup.md"
Task: "ARC integration guide in docs/arc-integration.md"
Task: "Troubleshooting documentation in docs/troubleshooting.md"
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies between them
- All tests must fail before implementation begins (TDD principle)
- Container security and SSL/TLS enforcement are mandatory throughout
- k3d cluster testing validates Kubernetes deployments
- Focus on <5 minute deployment and 100+ concurrent client requirements
- Maintain 99.9% uptime through HA configuration

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked before completion*

- [x] All contracts have corresponding tests (health-api.yaml → T005, deployment-api.yaml → T006)
- [x] All entities have configuration tasks (Deployment Manifest → T015-T016, Certificate Bundle → T022-T024, etc.)
- [x] All tests come before implementation (T005-T010 before T011+)
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent (different files, no shared dependencies)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] Container orchestration focus maintained throughout
- [x] Security-by-design and operational reliability principles embedded
