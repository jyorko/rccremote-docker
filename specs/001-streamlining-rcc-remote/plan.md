# Implementation Plan: RCC Remote Docker Streamlining & Enhancement

**Branch**: `001-streamlining-rcc-remote` | **Date**: 2025-10-02 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-streamlining-rcc-remote/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Streamline RCC Remote Docker deployment with enterprise-scale (100+ clients), sub-5-minute deployment, 99.9% uptime, automated SSL certificate management, comprehensive health checks, Kubernetes support, and ARC runner integration with catalog caching for resilience. Maintain container-first architecture with security-by-design principles.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Shell/Bash scripting, YAML manifests, Dockerfile configurations  
**Primary Dependencies**: Docker, Kubernetes, nginx, rccremote, k3d (for testing), openssl (certificate generation)  
**Storage**: Docker volumes (robocorp_data, hololib_zip_internal), persistent volumes for Kubernetes  
**Testing**: Integration testing with k3d cluster, RCC connectivity validation, SSL certificate verification  
**Target Platform**: Linux containers (Docker/Kubernetes), cross-platform RCC client support
**Project Type**: Container orchestration - infrastructure/deployment focused  
**Performance Goals**: <5 minute deployment, 100+ concurrent clients, 99.9% uptime  
**Constraints**: Container-first architecture, SSL/TLS mandatory, certificate auto-generation required  
**Scale/Scope**: Enterprise deployment, multi-environment support (dev/staging/prod), ARC runner integration

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Container-First Architecture**: ✅ PASS - Enhances existing containerization with Kubernetes support, maintains service boundaries (nginx/rccremote/rcc), adds proper health checks and resource constraints. Design includes HPA scaling, persistent volumes, and security contexts.

**Security-by-Design**: ✅ PASS - Strengthens SSL/TLS with automated certificate generation, fail-fast on cert failures, proper CA distribution, mandatory encryption for all connections. Security profiles enforce non-root users and minimal privileges.

**Environment Reproducibility**: ✅ PASS - Preserves existing RCC environment determinism, adds cross-platform deployment manifests, maintains ROBOCORP_HOME customization. Sample catalogs provide consistent testing across environments.

**Data Flow Transparency**: ✅ PASS - Adds comprehensive health endpoints with structured responses, enhanced logging for deployment/scaling events, Prometheus metrics for observability, diagnostic capabilities for troubleshooting.

**Operational Reliability**: ✅ PASS - Implements 99.9% uptime target with multiple replicas, automated recovery through Kubernetes, health/readiness/startup probes, graceful degradation with catalog caching for ARC runner resilience.

**Structure Decision**: Container orchestration project extending existing Docker setup with Kubernetes manifests, automated deployment scripts, comprehensive documentation, and integration testing using k3d clusters for validation.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh copilot`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Infrastructure setup: Kubernetes manifests, Docker Compose files, deployment scripts
- Contract validation: Health endpoint implementation, certificate API, deployment validation
- Integration testing: k3d cluster testing, RCC connectivity validation, load testing with 100+ clients
- Documentation: Deployment guides, troubleshooting, ARC integration setup
- Security hardening: Non-root containers, SSL/TLS enforcement, certificate management

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Foundation first: Base manifests, security profiles, certificate generation
- Testing infrastructure: Health checks, monitoring, validation scripts
- Integration validation: k3d deployment, RCC testing, load testing
- Documentation and examples: User guides, troubleshooting, ARC setup
- Mark [P] for parallel execution where files are independent

**Estimated Output**: 20-25 numbered, ordered tasks focusing on container orchestration and deployment automation

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
