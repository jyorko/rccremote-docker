# Research: RCC Remote Docker Streamlining & Enhancement

## Kubernetes Deployment Patterns for RCC Remote

**Decision**: Use standard Kubernetes Deployment + Service + ConfigMap pattern with PersistentVolumes
**Rationale**: 
- Provides horizontal scaling for 100+ concurrent clients requirement
- Enables 99.9% uptime with rolling updates and multiple replicas
- ConfigMap/Secret separation allows secure certificate management
- PersistentVolumes ensure holotree data survives pod restarts

**Alternatives considered**:
- StatefulSet: Rejected - RCC Remote doesn't require ordered deployment or stable network identities
- DaemonSet: Rejected - Don't need RCC Remote on every node
- Job/CronJob: Rejected - Need long-running service, not batch processing

## SSL Certificate Auto-Generation in Containers

**Decision**: Use init containers with cert-manager integration for Kubernetes, enhanced docker entrypoint for Docker Compose
**Rationale**:
- Init containers run before main application, ensuring certificates exist
- cert-manager provides automated certificate lifecycle management in K8s
- Fail-fast behavior aligns with clarified requirements (deployment must stop on cert failure)
- Separates certificate concerns from application logic

**Alternatives considered**:
- Sidecar containers: Rejected - Adds complexity without clear benefit
- External certificate provisioning: Rejected - Doesn't meet automation requirement
- Let's Encrypt directly: Rejected - May not work in isolated environments

## Health Check and Monitoring Strategies

**Decision**: Implement comprehensive health endpoints: /health/live, /health/ready, /health/startup with Prometheus metrics
**Rationale**:
- Kubernetes requires separate liveness, readiness, and startup probes for 99.9% uptime
- Prometheus metrics enable observability for 100+ concurrent client monitoring
- Startup probes handle slow RCC environment initialization
- Aligns with operational reliability constitutional principle

**Alternatives considered**:
- Simple HTTP 200 response: Rejected - Insufficient for enterprise reliability
- Custom health check script: Rejected - Less standardized than HTTP endpoints
- No health checks: Rejected - Violates availability requirements

## ARC Runner Integration Patterns

**Decision**: Use Kubernetes Service discovery with DNS names + catalog caching via persistent volumes
**Rationale**:
- Service DNS provides stable endpoint (rccremote.namespace.svc.cluster.local)
- Persistent volumes enable catalog caching for connectivity resilience
- Namespace co-location reduces network latency
- Supports clarified fallback behavior (cached catalogs when connectivity lost)

**Alternatives considered**:
- LoadBalancer service: Rejected - Adds external dependency, cost
- NodePort service: Rejected - Less secure, port management complexity
- Ingress-only: Rejected - ARC runners need direct service communication

## Performance and Scaling Architecture

**Decision**: Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) with resource-based scaling, nginx load balancing for Docker Compose
**Rationale**:
- HPA automatically scales based on CPU/memory to handle 100+ concurrent clients
- Resource-based scaling more predictable than custom metrics
- nginx provides load balancing when multiple rccremote instances needed
- Supports sub-5-minute deployment requirement through pre-built images

**Alternatives considered**:
- Vertical scaling only: Rejected - Single point of failure, limited scalability
- Custom metrics scaling: Rejected - Adds complexity, harder to tune
- Manual scaling: Rejected - Doesn't meet enterprise automation needs

## Container Security Hardening

**Decision**: Non-root user, read-only filesystem, minimal base images, security contexts
**Rationale**:
- Non-root execution reduces attack surface
- Read-only filesystem prevents runtime tampering
- Minimal images reduce vulnerability exposure
- Security contexts enforce least-privilege principle

**Alternatives considered**:
- Running as root: Rejected - Violates security-by-design principle
- Full filesystem access: Rejected - Unnecessary broad permissions
- Standard Ubuntu base: Rejected - Larger attack surface than needed

## Testing Strategy with k3d

**Decision**: Multi-stage integration testing: Docker Compose validation → k3d cluster deployment → RCC connectivity verification
**Rationale**:
- k3d provides lightweight Kubernetes testing environment
- Multi-stage approach catches issues at each deployment level
- RCC connectivity tests validate end-to-end functionality
- Automated testing supports 5-minute deployment target

**Alternatives considered**:
- Manual testing only: Rejected - Doesn't scale, error-prone
- Kind instead of k3d: Rejected - k3d specifically mentioned by user
- Unit tests only: Rejected - Container orchestration requires integration testing
