# Feature Specification: RCC Remote Docker Streamlining & Enhancement

**Feature Branch**: `001-streamlining-rcc-remote`  
**Created**: 2025-10-02  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Comprehensive recommendations to make RCC Remote Docker more streamlined, secure, and user-friendly with enhanced deployment options, security defaults, usability improvements, ARC runner integration, and general operational enhancements."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-02
- Q: What is the target scale for concurrent RCC client connections that the system should handle? → A: Large scale: 100+ concurrent clients (enterprise-wide)
- Q: When certificate generation fails, what should be the system behavior? → A: Fail deployment completely with clear error message
- Q: What is the maximum acceptable deployment time from start to fully operational RCC Remote service? → A: Under 5 minutes (fast iteration, development focus)
- Q: What should happen when ARC runners lose connectivity to RCC Remote during active operations? → A: Fall back to cached catalogs if available
- Q: What is the required uptime/availability target for the RCC Remote service in enterprise deployments? → A: 99.9% uptime (mission-critical, minimal downtime tolerance)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a DevOps engineer or automation developer, I want to deploy RCC Remote in a containerized environment with minimal configuration steps, secure defaults, and clear documentation so that I can quickly provide isolated RCC clients with reliable access to environment catalogs without compromising security or spending excessive time on setup.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am new to RCC Remote, **When** I follow the setup documentation, **Then** I can deploy a working SSL-enabled RCC Remote instance within 5 minutes using either Docker Compose or Kubernetes
2. **Given** I don't provide custom certificates, **When** I start the deployment, **Then** the system automatically generates valid SSL certificates and configures all components to use them
3. **Given** I want to integrate with ARC runners, **When** I deploy in Kubernetes, **Then** I can configure stable service discovery and SSL trust without manual certificate distribution
4. **Given** I have an existing deployment, **When** I need to troubleshoot issues, **Then** I can access comprehensive health checks and diagnostic information
5. **Given** I want to test the system, **When** I deploy, **Then** I have access to pre-built sample catalogs and testing tools

### Edge Cases
- What happens when certificate generation fails or certificates expire?
  - Certificate generation failure: System MUST fail deployment with detailed error message and remediation steps
- How does the system handle missing or corrupted environment catalogs?
  - Missing catalogs: System MUST log warning and continue serving available catalogs
  - Corrupted catalogs: System MUST quarantine corrupted files, log error with catalog name and checksum mismatch, and fallback to last known good version if available
- What occurs when ARC runners lose connectivity to RCC Remote?
  - ARC connectivity loss: System MUST fall back to cached catalogs if available, otherwise fail with clear connectivity error
- How does the system behave when storage volumes are full or unavailable?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide automated SSL certificate generation when custom certificates are not provided
- **FR-002**: System MUST enforce SSL/TLS for all client connections with certificate validation
- **FR-003**: System MUST include comprehensive health check endpoints for container orchestration
- **FR-003a**: System MUST support 100-500 concurrent RCC client connections with horizontal scaling capabilities and automatic load balancing
- **FR-004**: System MUST support both Docker Compose and Kubernetes deployment methods with clear documentation
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide stable service discovery mechanisms for ARC runner integration with catalog caching for connectivity resilience
- **FR-006**: System MUST run all containers with non-root users and minimal required privileges
- **FR-007**: System MUST include pre-built sample environment catalogs for testing and demonstration
- **FR-008**: System MUST support parameterized configuration through environment variables
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide persistent storage options for hololib and holotree data
- **FR-010**: System MUST include automated deployment scripts for common scenarios
- **FR-011**: System MUST fail fast with clear error messages when critical components are misconfigured
- **FR-012**: System MUST support namespace co-location with ARC runner scale sets in Kubernetes
- **FR-013**: System MUST automatically configure SSL trust profiles based on available certificates
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide comprehensive documentation for environment variable usage and security considerations
- **FR-015**: System MUST include readiness and liveness probes for robust orchestration
- **FR-016**: System MUST achieve 99.9% monthly uptime availability target with automated recovery mechanisms and <5 minute MTTR

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Deployment Manifest**: Configuration templates for Docker Compose and Kubernetes with parameterized values
- **Certificate Bundle**: SSL/TLS certificates (custom or auto-generated) with proper CA chain and validation
- **Health Endpoint**: Diagnostic interfaces providing system status and component health information
- **Sample Catalog**: Pre-built hololib ZIP files for testing and demonstration purposes
- **Service Configuration**: Kubernetes Service definitions with stable DNS names and port mappings
- **Security Profile**: Container security configurations with non-root users and minimal privileges
